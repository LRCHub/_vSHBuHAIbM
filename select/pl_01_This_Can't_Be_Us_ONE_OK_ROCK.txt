I hear your voice just like a song
And your melody
It tells me somethings wrong
They tell me that it won't be long
But in my head
It feels like you've already gone
Oh I don't know what to say
*
This can't be us
I don't know how to say goodbye
This can't be us
You've been the greatest part of my life
This can't be us
Can we turn back the time
This can't be us
I pray you're waking up
You gave more than enough
I won't forget your love
You've been my rock for way too long
And I'm sorry that I've been a rolling stone
You showed me how to build a home
You said "my heart is always with you" when
you're gone
Wish you could open up your eyes
*Repeat
I pray you're waking up
You gave more than enough
I won't forget your love
*Repeat
This can't be us
I don't know how to say goodbye
This can't be us
You've been the greatest part of my life
This can't be us
I think I'm going outta my mind
This can't be us
And if you don't wake up
I hope I said enough
I won't forget your love
